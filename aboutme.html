    <p class="talk">
    Just a 20 year old college girl who's lost in the world of movies and doesn't know her way out.<br>I love movies and I love to talk about movies. My reviews are my own opinions and would obviously sound disagreeable to some people, however I believe that differences in opinion are what adds charm to movies!
