  I'm starting this list with a movie that focuses on the theme of toxic friendships and relationships. The movie follows the story of Rachel, who's been in love with Dex since her college days. However, Dex is getting married to her best friend Darcy. Shortly before the marriage party, Rachel and Dex share their feeling to each other and realize that they've both been in love with each other for a while, but they misunderstood the other's feelings for friendship only and so Dex decided to get into a relationship with Darcy instead. After this revelation, Rachel and Dex get in a secret relationship, with Rachel cheating on her best friend, and Dex on his fiancee.<br>Now, the concept of this movie isn't special or unheard of, however what made it stand out to me as a horrible movie is how it made Rachel and Dex seem like they were in the right, and how it was trying to force us to sympathize with them. They both could have found a different solution to their problems, however they resorted to cheating and after Darcy found out, they both broke off their relationships with her and lived happily ever after. This movie gives a very bad message to viewers, and that is enough to make me hate it.

    The next movie on my list is set in a world where sightless mosters with advanced hearing have killed the majority of humanity, and we follow the lives of the Abbott family who live on an isolated farm in the middle of the forest and use sign language to communicate in order not to get found by the monsters. <br> Unlike the movie that I spoke about above, I didn't <i>hate</i> A quiet place, however I just had a hard time watching it to the end and I found the quietness of the movie rather boring. While the horrifying nature of the story's setting was very well done, and there were a few scenes that stuck with me, some of the plotholes in the movie left me questioning many things, like why didn't the family live closer to the river if it was easier for them to make noises next to the waterfall without being heard?

      All in all I found it hard to enjoy this movie, however it's not like I don't understand why it's popular. The movie was just not my cup of tea.

    The last movie on this list is Annabelle comes home. As a fan of the first Annabelle movie, I had high expectations coming into this one, however I was left disappointed. After the haunted doll Annabelle was secured by paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren in the earlier movies, this movie followed the story of their daughter's babysitter and her friend who barged into the room that Annabelle was stored in out of curiousity and ended up releasing the doll, causing a series of paranormal activities to occur in the house.<br>After watching the two earlier Annabelle movies, I found this movie to be rather boring and the sequence of events repetitive. Sure, the jump scares were there, however by the third movie I got pretty used to the pattern. Despite that, what really made me dislike the movie was definitely Daniela's character, as everything that happened throughout the movie was her fault. This girl barged into a stranger's house uninvited and started messing with their stuff without permission just because she wanted to meet her dead father again.

    Also, I can't wrap my head around the fact that the Warrens decided to store a demonic doll in their home, much less with them having a young daughter. Like...why?
