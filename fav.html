    I'm starting this list with my most favourite movie of all time, The Green Mile. Based on a book written by the renowned author Stephen King, the green mile is a movie which follows the story of Paul Edgecomb, the head guard of a prison, as he meets an African-American inmate named John Coffey who has been wrongly accused of murdering two little girls. <br>As the story goes on, Paul comes to discover that John happens to have powers that allow him to heal people by taking on their pain himself. The movie built up the friendship between Paul and John so beautifully, which made the scene of John's execution even more heartbreaking for me. I especially loved how Michael Clarke Duncan acted John's role, as he managed to portray the childish and pure-hearted personality of the <i>huge</i> John Coffey very well. Paul's regrets at the very end of the movie over not being able to save John or stop his execution reflected the very same emotions that I had towards John's death and I was left at the very end with feelings of bitterness at the brutality of the story.

    Next on my list is the movie that won Leonardo Dicaprio his long awaited oscar award, The Revenant. What's better than a good revenge story? This movie follows Hugh Glass, a fur trapper who gets attacked by a bear while hunting and is left in a near-death state. While unable to move, Hugh had to watch one of the hunters in his group kill his son in front of his eyes without being able to do anything about it.<br> After getting left behind in the snowy mountains to die alone, Hugh sets off on his mission to survive and take revenge against Fitzgerald, the man who killed his son. I personally didn't expect a movie with very little dialogue to keep me interested, but I wasn't able to take my eyes off the screen while watching it. Seeing what Hugh had to go through while trying to survive in his injured state made me sympathize alot with his character, especially with the harsh weather conditions that the story was set in.

    Needless to say, seeing Hugh kill Fitzgerald and avenge his son was very satisfying, however, the fact that it was hinted at the end of the movie that Hugh died shortly after left me feeling sad at the end.

    The last movie on my list is 1917. War movies are classics, especially movies about World war 1 and World war 2, however, this movie's different approach to the war movies category makes it stand out from the rest. 1917 is a movie set in world war 1 where two young soldiers, William Schofield and Tom Blake are sent on a mission to deliver a message asking Colonel Mackenzie of the 2nd Battlion of the Devonshire Regiment to call off an attack scheduled for next morning that would take the lives of 1600 men including Blake's brother Joseph.<br> I feel like the concept of delivering a message with a time limit added alot of tension in the movie. At the start of the movie, I believed that Blake was the main protagonist and that it was his mission to save his brother, so when he ended up dying at the early stages of the movie and leaving his brother's fate in his friend's hands, I was left speechless. The scene when Schofield was running across the battlefield to deliver the message at the last second was my favourite and it left me holding my breath.<br> The fact that the movie looked like it was all filmed in a single shot made it even more unique and special.
